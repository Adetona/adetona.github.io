        <p>On his expedition to Britain, Julius Caesar (55-54 BCE) dispatched a letter to Cicero in Rome. That urgent military correspondence crawled across the empire for 29 days.</p>
        
        <p>Nothing much changed for the next ~ 1,800 years, communication speeds remained as slow. A letter from Britain to Rome in 1800 AD would still take weeks, just as in Caesar's time.</p>
        
        <p>Until the invention of railways in the 19th century, a journey that took a month could be reduced to mere days. It reconfigured the society.</p>
        
        <p>Even after the advent of railways, another ~ 144 years passed before the next true revolution: the internet. Yes, there were advances like the telegraph, telephone, and fax machine, but none had the same civilizational impact as the internet.</p>
        
        <p>The internet reconfigured global communication, collapsing weeks into milliseconds and transforming human connectivity in a radical way.</p>
        
        <p>Electricity followed a similar pattern: thousands of years of candles and oil lamps, then sudden illumination that transformed every aspect of human life, from working hours to city planning to industrial capacity.</p>
        
        <p>Civilizational advancements usually take time to show up but when they show up, they reconfigure the society.</p>
        
        <p>I expect AI advance to follow the path of Railway, Electricity and Internet in reconfiguring our society.</p>
        
        <p>I'm absolutely not sure of the direction but cheaper access to intelligence will fast track progress in medicine (especially drug discovery), education, city planning and innovation.</p>
